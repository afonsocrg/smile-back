# SmileBack 😁

**Spread joy, one smile at a time**

[SmileBack](https://smile-back.afonsocrg.com) is an App designed to help you track the smiles you give to others and check how many people smile back.
The goal is to make this world a bit brighter by encouraging people to smile more, feel better, and ultimately be happier.

## 🚀 Try It Live!

The Smile Back app is live at **[smile-back.afonsocrg.com](https://smile-back.afonsocrg.com)**

## 📱 How It Works

Transform everyday moments into opportunities to spread joy:

1. **Open SmileBack** and keep it ready throughout your day
2. When you make eye contact with someone (on the street, public transport, in shops), give them the kindest and purest smile you have
3. Tap the appropriate button:
   - 😁 **Green button** if the person smiles back
   - 😔 **Gray button** if they don't smile back

**Remember**: No matter the outcome, whenever you smile at others, you make this world a better place. If they smile back, it's a wonderful bonus! ✨

## 🌍 Join the Movement

Every smile matters. Start your journey today and help create a chain reaction of positivity that ripples through our communities. 

**Remember: A smile is the shortest distance between two people.** 😊
