## What is SmileBack?

SmileBack helps you:
- Track how many people you smile at each day
- Record whether people smile back at you
- See your positive impact: total new smiles you've brought to the world
- Build a habit of spreading joy and kindness

## How it works

1. **Smile at someone** in real life
2. **Open the app** and record the interaction:
   - Tap "Person Smiled Back" if they returned your smile
   - Tap "Person Didn't Smile Back" if they didn't respond
3. **Watch your impact grow** - see how many new smiles you've created today

## Why track smiles?

- **Builds awareness** of your positive interactions
- **Encourages more smiling** by gamifying kindness  
- **Shows your impact** - every smile you give creates new positivity
- **Creates a positive feedback loop** that brightens your day
